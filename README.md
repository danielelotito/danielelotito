### Hey there! 👋

I'm a Research Scientist at IBM Research Europe and a PhD candidate at the University of Pisa.
I joined IBM Dublin Research Lab as a permanent researcher in March 2025 after two successful research internships at IBM. My work lies at the intersection of theoretical physics, statistics, and machine learning, with hands-on experience in large language models and computational biology.
This space is linked to my research activity at IBM and also hosts both my personal projects and companion repositories for my research papers.

- Check out "Mascarpone" - a card game I created with friends (and yes, it's named after the Italian dairy product! 🇮🇹). You'll find detailed statistical analyses of a couple of game scenarios
- Explore project4projects, my template for numerical simulations built with Hydra. The Mascarpone repository showcases its capabilities
