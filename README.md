### Hey there! 👋

I'm a Research Scientist at IBM Research Europe.

I joined IBM Dublin Research Lab as a permanent researcher in March 2025 after two successful research internships at IBM. I am interested in complex systems, statistics, and machine learning. I have hands-on experience in large language models and computational biology. 

I have a Master on theoretical physics, I focused on statistical physics of complex networks.

I hold a PhD in [AI](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it) and associative networks were my bread and butter.

This space is linked to my research activity at IBM and also hosts both my personal projects and companion repositories for my research papers.
