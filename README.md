### Hey there! 👋

I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Pisa, soon (March 2025) joining IBM Dublin Research Lab as a permanent researcher after two successful research internships at IBM. My work lies at the intersection of theoretical physics, statistics, and machine learning, with hands-on experience in large language models and computational biology. This space hosts both my personal projects and companion repositories for my research papers.

- Check out "Mascarpone" - a card game I created with friends (and yes, it's named after the Italian dairy product! 🇮🇹). You'll find detailed statistical analyses of a couple of game scenarios
- Explore project4projects, my template for numerical simulations built with Hydra. The Mascarpone repository showcases its capabilities
