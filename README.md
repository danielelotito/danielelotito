### Hey there! 👋

I'm a Research Scientist at IBM Research Europe.

I joined IBM Dublin Research Lab as a permanent researcher in March 2025 after two research internships at IBM. I am interested in complex systems, statistics, and machine learning. I have hands-on experience in large language models and computational biology. 

I have a Master in theoretical physics, I focused on statistical physics of complex networks.

I hold a PhD in [AI](https://phd-ai-society.di.unipi.it) and associative networks were my bread and butter.

This space hosts both my personal projects and companion repositories for my research papers.
